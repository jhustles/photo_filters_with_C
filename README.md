# Photo Filters Using C-Programming: 

![intro](./filter/images/readme/0_introPic.jpg)


## Scope & Purpose | Main Built-in Functionalities

* I wanted to further develop my proficiency in C, a lower level language, so I developed my own custom photo filters: Greyscale, Sepia, Reflection (Flipping the image), and Blur.

## System Prerequisites To Get Started

You will need the following installed on your computer system and import the following libraries:
* C
* Makefile

## Getting Started

* Download the repository
* Install Pre-requisites
* And run in an actual terminal, not a virtual one

## Code Review - Recruiters / Hiring Managers

* Please view the filter.c, helpers.c, helpers.h and bmp.h for all of core program, data structures, and algorithms

## Code Snippets

* Data Structures

* Sepia Filter Function

## Output Examples - Before And With Filters

### Example 1)

* Courtyard Before
![courtyard_before](./filter/images/courtyard.bmp)

* Courtyard Greyscale
![courtyard_greyscale](./filter/images/filtered_images/greyscale_courtyard.bmp)

* Courtyard Sepia
![courtyard_sepia](./filter/images/filtered_images/sepia_courtyard.bmp)

* Courtyard Reflection
![courtyard_reflection](./filter/images/filtered_images/reflection_courtyard.bmp)

* Courtyard Blur
![courtyard_blur](./filter/images/filtered_images/blur_courtyard.bmp)

### Example 2)

* Tower Before
![tower_before](./filter/images/courtyard.bmp)

* Tower Greyscale
![tower_greyscale](./filter/images/filtered_images/greyscale_tower.bmp)

* Tower Sepia
![tower_sepia](./filter/images/filtered_images/sepia_tower.bmp)

* Tower Reflection
![tower_reflection](./filter/images/filtered_images/reflection_tower.bmp)

* Tower Blur
![tower_blur](./filter/images/filtered_images/blur_tower.bmp)



## Next Steps Considerations

* Develop more filters
* Expand to accept all file types: jpg, pngs, and etc.


### Personal Note

* Hope you enjoyed it. Thank you for your time!
